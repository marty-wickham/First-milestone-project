## UX Design:

### Strategy

#### Who is this for?
The vision of this business is to produce games using traditional gaming styles, modelled on those of the 80’s and 90’s, delivered on a mobile platform. 
This provides a huge range for exposure demographically due the accessibility of this medium. Therefore, the initial target audience will probably be 
between the ages of 20 – 40, with scope for a growing target audience.

#### What type of content will be relevant? 
As the company is still in it’s formative stages, the main goals for the company will be increasing brand awareness, product awareness and creating more 
opportunities for expansion. In order to achieve this I will be focusing on three key areas of content;

Branding - the logo should be heavily emphasized and unique. I want to establish a font as well as a colour scheme.

Media content – to give a good sense of what each game is about, I will provide some screenshots of each working game as well as some play-through videos and possibly some concept art to provide additional background for the story of the games setting. 

Social media –  to further promote the business brand and content across other social media platforms.

### Scope

#### What does the client need?
* A brand name and logo to help make the business more recognisable and create a sense of familiarity.
* A mobile first website approach
* A catalogue page displaying any games the company has produced, including a brief outline of what each game is about and the style of play.
* Videos and screenshots will feature for each game respectively in the catalogue page to help anyone better visualise what kind of games the business has to offer.  
* Links to their social media pages

#### What else can we provide for the client?
* A news section that will update fans with any new products that are being released, or any new updates or bug fixes for current products
* A contact section to leave feedback about games, or for any potential collaborations with other people or businesses in the industry.

#### User scenarios
**Scenario:**
A fan would like to download a new game ---  
**Requirement:**
the ability to download the games via download links.

**Scenario:**
A fan wants to learn more about any other games the business has made ---  
**Requirement:**
The ability to view a catalogue of games the business has produced.

**Scenario:**
A fan wants to share videos and pictures of one of their favourite games ---  
**Requirement:**  
The ability to share links to the business’ social media pages.

**Scenario:**
A fan wants to get in touch about leaving feedback for a way t0 improve one of the games they play ---  
**Requirement:**  
The ability to access contact information to send an email to the business.

### Structure

#### Information Architecture
For this project I will be using a standard tree structure. To achieve this, the header of each page will 
consist of a navigation bar that contains the logo of the business and the main navigational links for each page in the website.

## Technology's Used:
Information Architecture

For this project I will be using a standard tree structure. To achieve this, the header of each page will 
consist of a navigation bar that contains the logo of the business and the main navigational links for each page in the website. 
* [HTML5](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_intro.asp) - a markup language used to create the structure of the webpage.
* [CSS3](https://www.w3schools.com/css/) - used to style the HTML code. 
* [Bootstrap4](https://getbootstrap.com/) - a front-end component library used to build responsive mobile-first desifn for this webpage.
* [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) - an icon library and toolkit used to implement various icons and social logos on this webpage
* [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) - a library of fonts that can eb imported in to your projects.
* [Cloud9](https://c9.io/wiickmar) - This is the IDE used to write and test the code for this project.
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/) - Git is a tool that is used to track and store changes to your codes as you work. It stores your code in a local repository.
* [Github](https://github.com/) - Github is a remote repository used to store our code. It is also used to deploy this project. 

## Testing
Most of the tesing for this project was done by myself. To do this I used the browser developer tools. This allowed me to observe how the layout of my
webpage responed at the various different screen widths. 

In order to achieve an appropriate layout for different devices and scren sizes I made use of *Bootstraps grid sytem* and any *media queries* where necessary.

I also used a *code validator* on [W3 Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input) to checks for any errors that needed to be fixed in my code. 

## Deployment 
1. The project was written and developed in the Cloud9 IDE.
2. A local repository was intialized using Git. Regular changes were commited to the local repository.
3. Github was used as a remote repository, and at the end of each development session, all local commits were pushed to (https://github.com/martycistudent/First-milestone-project)
4. Github pages was used to deploy this project from the master branch

Alt-H1 First Milestone Project / Astirian-Rae Games
___

Asirian-Rae Games is a small mobile-games company set up by my brother. They make mobile games using C# and Unity. 

## UX Design:

### Strategy

#### Who is this for?
The vision of this business is to produce games using traditional gaming styles, modelled on those of the 80’s and 90’s, delivered on a mobile platform. 
This provides a huge range for exposure demographically due the accessibility of this medium. Therefore, the initial target audience will probably be 
between the ages of 20 – 40, with scope for a growing target audience.

#### What type of content will be relevant? 
As the company is still in it’s formative stages, the main goals for the company will be increasing brand awareness, product awareness and creating more 
opportunities for expansion. In order to achieve this I will be focusing on three key areas of content;

Branding - the logo should be heavily emphasized and unique. I want to establish a font as well as a colour scheme.

Media content – to give a good sense of what each game is about, I will provide some screenshots of each working game as well as some play-through videos and possibly some concept art to provide additional background for the story of the games setting. 

Social media –  to further promote the business brand and content across other social media platforms.

### Scope

#### What does the client need?
* A brand name and logo to help make the business more recognisable and create a sense of familiarity.
* A mobile first website approach
* A catalogue page displaying any games the company has produced, including a brief outline of what each game is about and the style of play.
* Videos and screenshots will feature for each game respectively in the catalogue page to help anyone better visualise what kind of games the business has to offer.  
* Links to their social media pages

#### What else can we provide for the client?
* A news section that will update fans with any new products that are being released, or any new updates or bug fixes for current products
* A contact section to leave feedback about games, or for any potential collaborations with other people or businesses in the industry.
